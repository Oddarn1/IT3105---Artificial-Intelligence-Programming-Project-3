## Project 3 - Reinforcement Learning for the Mountain Car Problem using Coarse Coding

Purposes:
- Tailor your existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) system to handle coarse coding.
- Use that system to solve the classic Mountain Car control problem.
- Gain experience producing a short, educational video that documents your system and its results

The resulting video from this project is posted [here](https://studntnu-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/askas_ntnu_no/EUSS_zgqD3FLiZphZEt2YOQBuT25-MhgDQaHMF2sFya4XQ?e=RgzxBb
